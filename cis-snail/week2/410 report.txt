Exercise 2 report

2.Partitioning and Mounting: 
Run your Ubuntu VM image on your laptop, create two partitions on one of the two disks and mount them at /special and /data. Redirect the output of the mount commands to a file named mount.out. Also modify /etc/fstab so that these two partitions are mounted during the system reboot.
	I have met many problems on exercise 2. Firstly I have done the partition on the dev/sdb disk and want to do the mounting, but I got the error message that shows “wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on (the address), missing codepage or helper program, or other error”. I am not sure what’s  going on that, and there was not helpful solution on Google, then I try to mount the dev/sda partitions on /data and /special for testing, and those works. 
	After talking to professor and classmate, I unmounted the partitions on dev/sda, deleted the original /dev/sdb disk because it has only 2GB space and made a new disk with 20GB space. Then I made partitions and try to mount them on /mnt/data and /mnt/special, which got success. I also used the command “sudo mount -t auto -v /dev/sdb1 /mnt/special > mount.out” and “sudo mount -t auto -v /dev/sdb2 /mnt/data >> mount.out” for redirecting the output of mount commands, and modify /etc/fstab file with “/dev/sdb1 /mnt/special ext3 defaults 0 0” and “/dev/sdb2 /mnt/data ext3 defaults 0 0” for the partitions mounted during the system reboot. For directing the mount.out and modifying /etc/fstab files, I followed the instruction from Google without meeting less stuck than doing mounting part. 

3.Exploring File System: 
3.1. Gradually fill up /dev partition (e.g., by creating multiple copies of a very large file; "dd" and "yes" are two other commands that can "help" with that).
	Before doing exercise 3.1, I did many research on Google for making large file commands. There are two commands for dd and yes, which are 
“dd if=/dev/zero of=test count=(times of writing) bs=(bytes of single writing)”, 
and “yes abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 > largefile”.  
I also found a command “fallocate -l (file size) filename”, which was the fastest command among dd, yes and fallocate command. After the partition is roughly 100% full, I tried to use the command “echo ‘Hello world’ > file1”, then there was an error message says “-bash: echo: write error: No space left to device”. 

3.2. Write a program that opens a file and keeps writing on that file without closing the file
The code of the program:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	FILE *fp = NULL;
	int a = 1;
	fp = fopen(“test.txt”, “w+”);
	while(a=1){
		fprintf(fp, “Testing for fprintf…\n”);
	}
	return 0;
}

The unusual action I have taken: (i)manually delete the out file from the file system while the program is still writing on it.

The results of running the program, deleting the output file, and killing the program:
Before running the program, the available size of current directory is 269G.
When the a.out is running, the ls command shows there is a test.txt file, and the lsof test.txt command shows that the user is osboxes with a.out command. 
COMMAND  PID    USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE    SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME
a.out   5352 osboxes    3u   REG    8,5 13493547008 12845081 test.txt


3. When the output file is deleted while the a.out is still running, the ls command shows that there is no test.txt file, and the lsof command shows and error: No such file or directory. The current available directory size is 241G, which shows that the a.out still writing the text to the disk.

lsof: status error on test.txt: No such file or directory
lsof 4.89

4. When the a.out has been killed, the current size of the directory returned to 269G. 
5. Another unusual action: When opening the test.txt file while a.out was still running, the file was blank and the operation of the test.txt file was denied.














4. Setting Up RAID0 and RAID1:
I followed the instruction from Google to make RAID0 and RAID1. 
For RAID0: 
Personalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10] 
md0 : active raid0 sdc2[1] sdc1[0]
      10515968 blocks super 1.2 512k chunks
      
unused devices: <none>
ARRAY /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 name=osboxes:0 UUID=3b829cbc:0a480abe:14e5a0cb:ff3ad79f

UUID=2bb59693-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 none swap sw 0 0
UUID=28e58bde-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 / ext4 defaults 0 0
UUID=2bb59692-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 /boot ext4 defaults 0 0
UUID=2d09399a-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 /home ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/special ext3 defaults 0 0
/dev/sdb2 /mnt/data ext3 defaults 0 0
/dev/md0 /mnt/raid ext3 defaults 1 2

For RAID1:

Personalities : [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] [raid10] 
md0 : active raid1 sdc2[1] sdc1[0]
      4993856 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]
      
unused devices: <none>
ARRAY /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 name=osboxes:0 UUID=b8b7e1d0:af21e16f:52513c5d:a5aae79b

UUID=2bb59693-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 none swap sw 0 0
UUID=28e58bde-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 / ext4 defaults 0 0
UUID=2bb59692-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 /boot ext4 defaults 0 0
UUID=2d09399a-9a67-11e8-956d-080027402fd3 /home ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/special ext3 defaults 0 0
/dev/sdb2 /mnt/data ext3 defaults 0 0
/dev/md0 /mnt/raid ext3 defaults 1 2

5. Exploring Other File Types:
Not regular type files are the files distinguished with text of binary data, such as symbolic links, sockets and directories. For example, the "swap" file in /proc directory.
When using "cat swaps" command, it shows:

Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
/dev/sda4                               partition	6291452	0	-2

which is the partition type
